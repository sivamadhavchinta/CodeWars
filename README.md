Each run of the game will be a contest between two teams, red and blue, which shall signify the code/script of two teams which actually participate in our contest.

There are two key commodities in the game : Virus and Elixir

The Base has an initial supply of Elixir, using which it could create more robots (each one of which will run the Robot’s part of the script the team submits), but no virus.

The Screen/Canvas will be represented by a 40 by 40 (mostly!) grid, which will have Elixir stored on some of its locations and Virus on others.

The Virus shall be renewed after a said number of turns but not the Elixir.

The Robots created by the base could wander around the map, collecting Virus & Elixir, and discovering the other team’s base, so that they could **attack** it.

The Elixir any robot acquires is its own, whereas any virus it acquires belongs to its team, and is stored at the base, but can be deployed by any of its robots in whatever amount they see fit.

Whenever Virus is deployed on any enemy robot/base, it reduces its Elixir in a 1:1 ratio.

The Game ends if any particular team has no elixir left (in which case the other team wins!)

or if 1500 timeframes have passed in which case, we’ll take the moving average of the elixir of both the teams in order to determine the winner.
